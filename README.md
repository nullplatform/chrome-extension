# Usage: Retrieve your personal access token

To retrieve your personal access token, just:

1. Log in to nullplatform in a Chrome tab.
2. Click the nullplatform extension icon.
3. A popup will appear showing **your personal access token**.
4. Click **Copy to clipboard** to easily paste it into any cURL command or script.

# Troubleshooting

If you see the following message when using the extension:

> *"No token found. Make sure youâ€™re logged in to nullplatform in this tab."*

This usually means one of the following:

1. You're not on a logged-in nullplatform tab

    Make sure you have the platform open in a tab where you are already logged in. Then click the extension again.

2. You need to update the extension

    If youâ€™re still seeing this message while on a logged-in tab, update the extension:

      - Remove it and reinstall following the steps in [How to install or update](#how-to-install-or-update)

    We release periodic updates, so make sure youâ€™re using the latest version.
